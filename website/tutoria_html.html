                    So what exactly are semantics? Semantics within HTML is the practice of giving content on the 
                    page meaning and structure by using the proper element. Semantic code describes the value of 
                    content on a page, regardless of the style or appearance of that content. There are several benefits 
                    to using semantic elements, including enabling computers, screen readers, search engines, and other devices 
                    to adequately read and understand the content on a web page. Additionally, semantic HTML is easier to manage 
                    and work with, as it shows clearly what each piece of content is about.
